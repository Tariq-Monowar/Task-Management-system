### Task Management system frontend

#### Workflow:
1. **Sign Up**: First, sign up to become a part of the system.
2. **Create Project**: After signing up, you can create a new project.
3. **Add Users to Project**: Once the project is created, you can add other users to the project with roles as Admin or Developer.
4. **Create Tasks**: Create tasks within the project and assign them to specific users. Once assigned, the respective user will receive a real-time notification. Only the assigned user and project admins/managers will be able to edit the task.
5. **Task Completion Notification**: Once the task is completed, project admins and managers will receive a notification.
6. **Mark Project as Complete**: Once all tasks within the project are completed, the "Complete" button will be enabled. Clicking it will mark the project as completed. (and more...)
